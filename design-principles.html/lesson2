        <h2>PARC: Alignment of Denver Museum of Arts Homepage</h2>

        <!--hyperlink to site-->

        <!--image here -->

        <p>This site shows excellent use of alignment. Each
            heading lines up with the following heading or 
            image and it keeps the block sections
            throughout without too much similarity. It is pleasing
            to the eye and easy to see how each section aligns 
            with the next.
        </p>
        
        <h2>PARC: Repetition of Denver Museum of Arts Art Section</h2>

        <!--hyperlink and img-->

        <p>This link on the site gives us a great example of Repetition
            as it continues the left and right block formation from the homepage. 
            It also has repetition of the fonts and layout from the homepage.
        </p>

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design on Denver Museum of Arts Programs Section</h2>

            has nice clean alignment and color use to give the focus to each
