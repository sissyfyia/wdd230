    <h1>Our Target Audience</h1>
    <p>We aim to serve all citizens within the town of Manassa but with the demographics
        within the town our majority would be Males aging 50 to 60 years of age and women in their
        early 60s. People that have lived here most of their lives or have a very strong connection 
        to the area due to family connection or heritage. There are also a large number of teenagers
        living in the town that we would like to focus on to encourage growth and development through
        the coming years. These are people with a high school diploma and possibly some college. The 
        average income is under 70k a year and a pointed focus on family relations and connection. 
    </p>

    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <h3>Jedediah Suthaby, DVM</h3>
    <h4>Head Veterinary Doctor of Easy Care Vet Clinic/Owner</h4>
    <p>
        Doctor Suthaby is a strong supporter of the community and very familiar with the local
        population through his work and volunteer ventures. He is a trustworthy and outspoken 
        52-year-old father of 4.
        
        His work is highly demanding as he focuses on large animals and travels to accomodate
        local farmers and ranchers with their variety of needs. He runs and owns the local Vet 
        clinic. 

        As a long-time resident who spend several years outside the community obtaining his degree
        he has plenty to offer in growth without changing the desires of the local population to 
        keep tight knit community strong. Famous for saying "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."

    <h3>Magdalena Rodriguez</h3>
    <h4>Retired School Teacher</h4>
    <p>
        Having taught elementary school at the local Manassa Elementary for 30+ years, Ms. Rodriquez
        is a highly valued member of the community. Most of the new parents in the area were taught 
        by Ms. Rodriquez and she is regarded as a pilar of the community.

        Having lived and taught her entire life in the same county as Manassa, Ms. Rodriquez has a 
        vast understanding of the people in the area and the needs of the community. As only a teacher
        can, Ms. Rodriquez has experienced the struggles and needs of all diverse groups within the town. 
        She has the knowledge and compassion to guide others ideas and desires. All her students have heard 
        her say "You are what you put into it."
