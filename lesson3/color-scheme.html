        <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
    </header>
    <p>When coming up with the color scheme for out town we took into consideration the natural area, 
        the history and what would best represent us. Manassa is a desert area but also has blue sky
        most of the year. The mountains give a beautiful blue hue and water is our most valuable source.
        The land is the main source of income for most people as ranching and farming is the economy. 
        This color pallette shouts Manassa.
