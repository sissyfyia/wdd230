                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                Manassa has a very rich history of Spanish settlers and Pioneers from the Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter-day Saints who settled the area. With help from the Manassa Project and 
                the LDS Family History Center there are many resources available to find more deep history.

                <p>
                    The name that brought Manassa fame is none other than Jack Dempsey the American world

                    June 24, 1895 and always held the town in high regard throughout his life. Small beginnings
                    lead to great endings.
